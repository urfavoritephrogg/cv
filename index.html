    <h2><u>Bio</u></h2>
    <p>My name's Ethan, I'm currently 14 and I go to Northwood Middle School. I love sports, I'm a big track guy, (IDK if you can count that as a sport) and I love anything to do with computers, as you could probably guess from reading my first webpage. Some of my hobbies include drawing, working out, and developing projects like this one. When it comes to my family I think I have to be the most blessed. My mom is the coolest one I know, my dad is always super supportive of me, (he actually funded this believe it or not) and I have the nicest two brothers I could ever ask for. I might include a picture of them sometime but I don't exactly know how to do that yet ;) One of my all time favorite things to do is to curl up with a hot chocolate when it's cold out and just watch whatever I can find on my youtube page that day. Especially when my dog hops up and watches with me. Anyway, I think that's enough about me, JK this whole page is about me! <strong>MWAHAHA...</strong></p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I've attended more than three schools in my day [if you want to count preschool]. I've been through very early homeschool, preschool, then to Woodview elementary. Midway through that, I transitioned to Wakarusa elementary, and now I'm in eighth grade as a Northwood student, about to enter my freshmen year! </p>
